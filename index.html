      <p class="indent">My name is Josue Luii Ramos-Calvario. I was born in San Diego, CA but lived the first few years of my life in Tijuana, Baja California, 
        Mexico. My parents permanently moved to San Diego when I was 6. I graduated from Castle Park High School in 2008 and continued my studies at the United States 
        Naval Academy Preparatory School (NAPS) from 2008-2009. Upon graduating from NAPS, I went on to the United States Naval Academy where I obtained a B.S. in 
        Systems Engineering with a focus on Computer Vision.</p>
      <p class="indent">Upon comissioning from USNA, I served a tour on USS Gonzalez (DDG 66) as the Auxiliaries Officer and performed the duties as the Ship's 
        Quality Assurance Officer and 1 of 2 Anti-Submarine Warfare Evaluators. I served on USS Princeton (CG 59) as the Damage Control Assistant where I continued to 
        be 1 of 2 ASWEs. I am currently serving as a Training Liason Officer at Littoral Combat Ship Squadron One (LCSRON ONE).</p>
      <p class="indent">On my free time I like to build and program robots, workout, play soccer and binge watch Netflix shows. My all time favorite show is the 
        Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. I may or may not have an unhealthy obsession for the Green Power ranger. I enjoy watching movies1 as well, my favorite genre is 
        definitely comedy and all of the Marvel movies.</p>
